Initialize l (left) and r (right) to 0 and the length of the matrix minus 1, respectively. This defines the boundaries of the 
current layer.

Use a while loop to iterate while l is less than r. This loop continues until you have rotated all the layers.

Within the loop, initialize top and bottom to l and r, respectively. These variables represent the top and bottom rows of 
the current layer.

Use a for loop to iterate through the elements within the current layer, from the left to the right of the layer (from l to r).

Inside the loop, store the value of the top-left element of the current layer in a temporary variable top_left.

Update the four corners of the current layer:

Set the top-left element to the bottom-left element.
Set the bottom-left element to the bottom-right element.
Set the bottom-right element to the top-right element.
Set the top-right element to the top_left (the value saved in step 5).
Increment l to move to the next layer's left boundary and decrement r to move to the next layer's right boundary.

Repeat steps 3-7 for the next layer until all layers have been rotated.

By following these steps, the code rotates the matrix layer by layer, and at the end of the process, the matrix is rotated 90 degrees 
clockwise in-place.

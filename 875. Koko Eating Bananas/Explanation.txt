Initialize a range for possible eating speeds, l (minimum speed) and r (maximum speed), and initialize ans to positive infinity to store the minimum speed found.

Perform a binary search within the range l to r.

In each iteration, calculate the middle eating speed, mid, and use it to estimate the time required to eat all the bananas by iterating through the piles and dividing the number of bananas by mid. Use math.ceil to round up to the nearest hour.

If the estimated time is less than or equal to the given time h, it means we can consume the bananas within the time limit. Update ans with the minimum of the current ans and mid, and narrow the search range by setting r to mid - 1.

If the estimated time is greater than h, it means we need a faster eating speed. Adjust the search range by setting l to mid + 1.

Repeat the binary search until l is greater than r.

Return the ans as the minimum eating speed required to eat all the bananas within the given time.

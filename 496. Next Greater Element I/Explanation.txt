Stack for Tracking:

The stack is used to keep track of elements in nums2 as we iterate through them.
We are interested in finding the next greater element for each element in nums2, and the stack helps us maintain a decreasing order of elements.
Iterative Comparison:

Iterate through each element in nums2.
For each element, compare it with the elements at the top of the stack.
If the current element is greater than the element at the top of the stack, update the dictionary curr with the next greater element.
Dictionary for Mapping:

The dictionary curr is used to store the mapping of an element to its next greater element.
After iterating through nums2, curr contains the information needed to find the next greater element for any element in nums2.
Mapping for Result:

Iterate through each element in nums1.
Check if the element is in the curr dictionary.
If it is, append the corresponding next greater element to the result list (ans); otherwise, append -1.

Certainly! The code aims to efficiently find, for each query, the leftmost building that is taller than or equal to the 
building at the query index. 
It uses a stack to keep track of the buildings in decreasing order of height and pre-processes the heights array to quickly 
find the next taller building for each building. 
The algorithm handles different cases, such as when the query indices are equal, 
when the height at the second index is greater than the height at the first index, or when there's no next taller building available. 
The final result is a list of indices representing the leftmost taller or equally tall building for each query.

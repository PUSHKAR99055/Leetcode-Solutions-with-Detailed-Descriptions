All such problems usually could be solved by sliding window approach in a linear
time. The challenge here is how to implement constant-time slice
to fit into this linear time.

If the patterns are not known in advance, i.e. it's "find duplicates" problem,
one could use one of two ways to implement constant-time slice: Bitmasks or Rabin-Karp.
Please check article Repeated DNA Sequences
for the detailed comparison of these two algorithms.

Here the situation is more simple: patterns are known in advance, and the set
of characters in the patterns is very limited as well: 26 lowercase English letters.
Hence one could allocate array or hashmap with 26 elements and use it as a
letter counter in the sliding window.

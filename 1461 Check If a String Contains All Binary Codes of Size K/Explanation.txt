Initialize a set called hash to store unique binary codes of length k.
Iterate through the input string s, considering all possible substrings of length k.
Check if the current substring of length k is already in the hash set. If not, add it to the set.
After processing all possible substrings, compare the size of the hash set to 2^k.
Return True if the sizes are equal, indicating that all possible binary codes of length k are present; otherwise, return False.

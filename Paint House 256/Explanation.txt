Intuition
There are 3 possible column we can start from i.e. Red, Green and Blue
We want to traverese the different columns from and the sub problem will be the next possible columns we can go to.

Approach
So starting from (0,0), (0,1), (0,2) we start searching minimum from our next possible options. 
Adding all the intermediate rows results and returning it. 
Now taking the minimum of all the starting traversals is the result and what we would return as our final answer.

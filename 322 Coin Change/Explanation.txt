This code is a Python implementation of a solution to the Coin Change problem, which aims to find the minimum number of coins needed to make a specific amount of money using a given set of coin denominations. Here's how it works:

The function coinChange takes two arguments: coins (a list of coin denominations) and amount (the target amount we want to make change for).

The core logic of the solution is implemented within the dfs (depth-first search) function, which is decorated with memoization using @cache. This means it stores previously computed results to avoid redundant calculations.

In the dfs function:

If i (the current coin index) exceeds the length of the coins list or if the target becomes negative, it means that we can't make change with the provided coins, so the function returns positive infinity (inf).

If the target becomes 0, it means we've successfully made change, and the function returns 0, indicating that no more coins are needed.

The function considers two possibilities:

Exclude the current coin by calling dfs(i+1, target). This represents the case where we don't use the current coin denomination.
Include the current coin by calling dfs(i, target - coins[i]). This represents the case where we use the current coin denomination.
The function returns the minimum of these two possibilities as the result.

The ans variable is set to the result of dfs(0, amount), which represents the minimum number of coins needed to make change for the target amount using the provided coins.

If it's not possible to make change (i.e., ans remains positive infinity), the code returns -1 to indicate that it's impossible to make the given amount using the provided coins.

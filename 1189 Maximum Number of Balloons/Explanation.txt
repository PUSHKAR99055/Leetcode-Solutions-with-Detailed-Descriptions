The curr dictionary is initialized to store the counts of each of the required characters ('b', 'a', 'l', 'o', 'n'). 
Initially, all counts are set to 0.

A for loop iterates through each character in the text string.

Inside the loop, it checks if the current character i is one of the required characters ('b', 'a', 'l', 'o', 'n'). 
If it is, it increments the corresponding count in the curr dictionary.

The string s is set to 'balloon'. This is the word we want to count in the input string.

The method returns the minimum count among the counts of 'b', 'a', 'n', 'l' (divided by 2 because there are two 'l's in "balloon"), 
and 'o' (divided by 2 because there are two 'o's in "balloon"). 

This accounts for the fact that you need two 'l's and two 'o's to form a single instance of "balloon."
